After applying for a bunch of different companies in the ultimate search of software developer position I came to the surprising realization of how ugly the hiring process is, most of the times. 

The best experience so far is with Dropbox. They have a distinct section for fresh college grads, where you choose the desired role, then type your name and choose a cv from dp folder. Done. Took 30 seconds. All that with their signature sleek interface. 

Failry good experience I had with Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. They require you to fill out the experience/education forms again and again, but at least they have a nice UI and you can expect to finish in reasonable amount of time. Also at FB you can directly choose a reference person who is already there.

Now, that's about it for a good application experience. All the other companies, especially the big corporations are terrifyingly ugly. More often than not you need to create a separate account (as if you didn't have a myriads of them already) with the **strong password**, then go through pain of filling endless questionnaires designed by brainless idiots who apparently knew nothing about neither usability nor elegance. There you have ambiguous questions, tons of mandatory fields that could have been avoided etc. All that while having terrible UI.
