title: Visualizations in Python via Pandas and Matplotlib

I've grown to be quite a fan of Python tools for plotting - namely, Matplolib library, and other packages that uses it, i.e. Pandas. Community is also great, all the questions has long been answered on StackOverflow. 

In this post I just want to share and preserve those useful methods and approaches that I came up with while working on my bio data analysis. Below is the result plot and how it could be done with extensive comments:
