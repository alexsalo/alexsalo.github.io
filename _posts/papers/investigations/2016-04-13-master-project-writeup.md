title: Data Interpretation and Learning on Heterogeneous Behavioral Data Sets
---
Below is my first real paper in English: a master's project write-up at ECS, Baylor University. Acedemic writing, surprisingly, proved to be easier (for non-native) than publicistic style: we want to use short, precise and concise words (which are easier to know since they mostly universal due to the Latin roots) with simple sentence structure, and generally avoid very long complicated sentences like this one, which is so prone to ample mistakes. Anyways, here is an abstract for the PDF attached (click on the image):

> The Monkey Alcohol and Tissue Research Resource (MATRR) is a rich data repository containing heterogeneous experimental data derived from well-documented non-human primate alcohol self-administration studies. This macaque model has demonstrated categorical drinking norms reflective of human drinking populations. By thorough analysis of the available data we are able to better understand the causative agents, progression and features of alcoholism.

> This project presents investigation results separated into two sections: the first describes the rapid discovery and testing of new hypothesis; the second describes the detailed study of predicting future levels of alcoholism based on early (induction) drinking and behavioral data using machine learning techniques. Each study takes advantage of a different set of tools and traces their effectiveness, validity and limitations when describing data in meaningful visual form. We also explore the assignment and cross-examination of data from different sources, and how they aid in generating hypothesis and observing gender and drinking category differences.
