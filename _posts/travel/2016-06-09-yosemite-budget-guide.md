title: Yosemite Budget Camping without Reservation
---
Yosemite is awesome! The best time to go is Spring: you would have plenty of flow for the waterfalls, and it is much nicer to hike without extensive sweating.

How to go Yosemite in the cost efficient manner and without six-months-in-advance-reservation? Here is a short guide.

1. Camp 4 is first come first served and fits about 200 people. It's only $6 per person. The problem is to get a spot. Your best chance is during "unpopular" time: not Friday or Saturday, "cold" weather, early in the morning (some people line up starting at 5 am). Your chances are actually pretty good if you come on Sunday at 10 am when the forecast predicts 32F for the night.
2. If that fails, you can try to get one of the canceled reservations. People don't tell you about this, but it is actually a legit way to get a spot. Generally, 10-20 people would cancel their stay in the Lower and Upper Pines to get a refund. Those spots would be given aways at 3 pm to those who signed up at the "campground reservations" in the parking lot of the Pines. The sooner you signing up - the better the chances. We've tried two times, both times successfully. Keep in mind that many people get into the list but then don't show up at 3 pm. So the strategy is to try get a spot at Camp4, but if nothing is available - sing up for waiting list in Pines.
3. If both fails, you can either camp at the Tamarack flats (hardly accessible by RVs and no utilities makes it unpopular, luckily for us) or go into the wild and camp in one of the many available spots - just talk to the ranger for a permit and bear can.
4. After a day hike you want a shower. For some reason this is not advertised, but super nice showers are available at housekeeping for $5, which includes a towel and shampoos. Water is hot. Time is 45 mins. You can not ask for a better shower.
