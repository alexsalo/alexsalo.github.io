title: Turn Off Your WiFi for X minutes
---
As usual, this app was born to solve the problem, that I encountered way too often to ignore the opportunity for the optimization. 

### Use Case:
Whenever I walk through campus my cellphone picks up the university's wifi connection. Since I'm not actually inside the building, the connection is so weak that it barely works. Importantly doesn't work good enough for Skyping, which is logical thing to do when you walk through campus without doing anything useful. To fight that problem I normally turned wifi off.. and surely kept forgetting to turn it back on whenever arrived, which led to extra cell traffic consumption and tha lack of in-time sync (e.g. I only sync photos with wifi). 

As a solution I made this android app that allows to turn your wifi OFF for X minutes (you can adjust and save X); then it automatically turns it back ON.
