The revelation of the day: Polymer and Vulcanization for web dev.

Polymer is a new library from Google that aims to extend basic HTML components with very neat and universal, yet blazingly fast and easy DOM level components. The idea is that you can use nice and beautiful components made by best designers just in any framework you like. Paper cards are great - supporting material design. And yes, they are responsive - all the nasty screen size adaptation is taken care of.

The second one is the concept of vulcanization, which is just an idea of combining all the html together in one file, and all the js in the other, so that the client would only need to do a minimal number of http requests, which dramatically reduces the load time.
