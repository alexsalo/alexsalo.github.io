title: Cash Rewards and Sign Up Bonus
---
Being a [Mustashian](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/), as I learnt only recently (many Russians are anyway), I like to see precisely how my money flow in and out. It's been a year since I started to play the Credit Game, and now when my score was high enough to get some classic credit cards I'm ready to do some evaluation. 

Firstly, primary reasons for credit cards are:
- Protection against fraud
- Risk diversification - use credit cards in seedy places
- Cash Back Rewards
- Some other perks like free rental insurance

I decided to start with BoF Cash Rewards which promised a $100 sing-up bonus after I spent $500 in first three months. Since I can pay my electricity and at&t bills with the credit cards without any fees, along with the groceries of course, I decided $500 would not take longer then a couple of months anyway. 

Here is what I've got:

Surprisingly, I've gotten rewards on almost all the purchases (I did not plan individual purchases) since card makes 3% (instead of base 1%) on gas and groceries. Additionally, as promised, I received a $100 signing bonus. 

(Important caveat: I know that for many people it's very hard to control what they buy when the see buzz words "free", "reward" etc; I tend to believe I'm almost free of such impulses and all the purchases I would have made regardless of the whether or not I get a cash back bonus) 

Now the coolest part is that nobody forces me to spent this cash right away (although they try to advertise various stores and deals). I simply chosen to redeem as a direct deposit to my checking account. I was surprised that for doing so I actually receive additional %10 loyalty bonus:

Additionally, I actually used Chase Freedom credit card. I have had to flight for onsite interviews and had to spend reimbursable money - I figured free cash back would be nice. There were "spend $300 in three months" deal too so I've gotten additional $100 bonus. 

To compare cards: Chase's freedom gives much better CL, but their online banking is garbage. They use points instead of actual currency which hinders analysis and that I don't like.  

PS this post inspired by [Brandon's blog](http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5669283816275968) which is a nice story to read. Reading, writing and thinking about things allows be to better understand nature, and that, in turn, makes me a happier primate. 

PSS ugly $100 for at&t is due to the new user on my account which covers two month of the usage. Normally I pay only $30, which still a whole lot for the little of simple service I need.
