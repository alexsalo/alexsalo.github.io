title: Everyday Design: Microwave
---
When I earn enough money I plan to embark on the journey of designing better things. It is mysteriously surprising why everyday things around us are designed, often, so poorly. As an example, let's consider the microwave from my apartment:

Looks typical? Sadly, yes. Here is why this design is sad:

- Running line on the display is ridiculously annoying. In general, running lines should be avoided everywhere because they distract us, and it is hard to read the information anyways. You can always shorten the words or better not use them at all: make it self evident. In this case, microwave provides very valueable info: **touch start...**
