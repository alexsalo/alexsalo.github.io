title: Mobile Apps That Don't Get Job Done, or Web Anti-Patterns
---
So much more often than not users are being solicited with the "Install our new super awesome mobile app", which does not fulfil the goals for which they tried to access the web resource in the first place. Annoying pop up often prevents from getting further, but even if you manage to close the pop up - you'll most likely get a mobile version of the web site. 

While apps and mobile versions of the sites are great and have some significant advantages, they often just don't provide with the full functionality of the original resource, and rightly so. Well, the thing is, sometimes you just absolutely need to access the full version to get what you want. Alternatively, you don't want to spend your space on the device (especially in today's world of ridiculous >50 MB apps for something really unimportant), or you want to spare the internet connection - the list goes on and on. 

So the rule of thumbs for developers is: allow **easy, obvious** access to the full version of the web site on the mobile devices. 

Another anti-pattern is to unilaterally turn on the sound on the mobile device. That's just horrible, really. Never, never play sound on the mobile unless user asks for it. Facebook and Instagram recently realized that (obvious) idea which is great. Other devs should follow too.

P.S. As usual, screenshot doesn't capture video frames. In reality, video **is playing** without me starting it.
